## Integrating Xray with Amazon Redshift

To inspect and execute queries in an Amazon Redshift database using the Xray library, follow these steps:

### Create a Go Application

Start by creating a main.go file in your Go project and add the provided example in `main.go` code into it.

### Run the Application

Once you have added the example code to your main.go file, execute the following commands in your terminal:

```
go mod tidy
go run main.go
```
That's it! You should now be able to inspect and execute queries in your Amazon Redshift database using Xray in your Go application.
